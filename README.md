Passive RF Emitter Geolocation with an Intelligent Drone Swarm

ðŸ“– Overview
This project simulates a swarm of autonomous drones tasked with finding a hidden, stationary radio frequency (RF) emitter in a 2D environment with obstacles.

The core of this project is an implementation of an intelligent, multi-agent system that uses Bayesian inference to manage uncertainty and an information-theoretic planner to make optimal decisions. Instead of wandering randomly or simply moving towards the strongest signal, the swarm works cooperatively to reduce its collective uncertainty about the emitter's location as efficiently as possible.

This serves as a powerful demonstration of applying probabilistic AI to solve a real-world robotics and intelligence problem.
